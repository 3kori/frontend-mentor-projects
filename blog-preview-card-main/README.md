## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i learn how to use flexbox more efficiently, making the page responsive and adding a box shadow.

Below are code snippets of what I learned.
```css
@media(max-width: 375px){
    .container {
        max-width: 327px;
    }

    .learn-box {
        width: 73px;
        height: 26px;
    }
}

@media(max-width: 320px){
    .container {
        max-width: 272px;
    }

    .learn-box {
        width: 82px;
        height: 29px;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Learn flexbox the easy way(Kevin Powell)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) - This helped me understand the concept of flexbox. I really liked how the idea  was executed in that resource.
- [Box shadows](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp) - This is an amazing resource which helped me finally understand box shadows. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing resource which helped me finally understand how media queries work. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
